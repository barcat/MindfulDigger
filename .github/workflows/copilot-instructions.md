### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### ASP_NET

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints in .NET 6+ applications to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the mediator pattern with MediatR for decoupling request handling and simplifying cross-cutting concerns
- Use API controllers with model binding and validation attributes for {{complex_data_models}}
- Apply proper response caching with cache profiles and ETags for improved performance on {{high_traffic_endpoints}}
- Implement proper exception handling with ExceptionFilter or middleware to provide consistent error responses
- Use dependency injection with scoped lifetime for request-specific services and singleton for stateless services

#### ENTITY_FRAMEWORK

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}


## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements
